# youtube-anti-adblock-bypass
A way to bypass the anti-adblock on youtube using ublock origin! No extra extensions or tools required!

### Warning: This is a work in progress and stuff may break so please report any issues! This has only been thoroughly tested in firefox and barely checked in chrome derivatives. Changes may be made in the future so I'd suggest bookmarking or starring this project.

# How to install
- Step 1: Install Ublock Origin from your browser's extension store. E.G the [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) store, [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) store etc. Then add the extension to your browser.
- Step 2 : Click on the Ublock icon, then click on settings
